BinarySearch -> Algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
               
FirstBadVersion -> You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
                    Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
                     Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, 
                   You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version)  Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
                   You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 RotateArray -> Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps,
                 where k is non-negative.
 
 Squares of a Sorted Array -> Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
                              return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 MoveZero ->
                       Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.                                      Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
                       Output: [1,3,12,0,0]


Sum Of Two Numbers:           Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], 
                              target = 9
                              Output: [1,2]
                              Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9.   
                              Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
                              We return [1, 2].
