BinarySearch -> Algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
               
FirstBadVersion -> You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
                    Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
                     Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, 
                   You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version)  Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
                   You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 RotateArray -> Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps,
                 where k is non-negative.
 
 Squares of a Sorted Array -> Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
                              return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
